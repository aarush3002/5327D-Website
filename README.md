## The Team

Our team, 5327D, is one of five sister teams within the Gael Force.
As a team, we value the competitive spirit and always strive to give our best at any comp.
However, our team values the knowledge and active involvement of our members over our competitive superiority.
As a team, we ensure that each of our members know every aspect of VEX robotics, from the different motor gearings to the fine workings of a reverse-double four bar.
Our captain is Ayush Roy. This is his second year in VEX robotics. He specializes in build and notebook. He has a burning passion for robotics and wants his team to be at their competing peak.
Our lead programmer is Aarush Aitha. This is his first year as a member of the Gael Force, but his second year of VEX overall.
